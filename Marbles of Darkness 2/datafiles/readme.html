        <li>18 powerups to help you created by cascades</li>

    <br>

    <h3 id="General">General instructions</h3>
    <img src="media/image2.jpg" alt="Gameplay" width="800px">
    <p>
        The game is played using a mouse. A stream of coloured orbs is rolling along a marked path. 
        The shooter points at the mouse cursor and shoots the orb displayed on it when clicked. 
        The shot orb joins the stream of rolling orbs upon contact. 
        By making a group of 3 or more orbs with the same colour, they will be removed. 
        Clearing orbs increases the bar at the bottom. Fill it completely to stop any more streams from appearing. 
        Clear all orbs to complete the level. You must not let any orbs reach the hole at the end of the path!
    </p>
    <p>
        When removing any orbs leaves matching ones on both ends of the gap, they will be pulled together and, 
        if another group of 3 or more forms, remove themselves. This is called a combo.
        A chain is when you create a successful match with multiple shot orbs in a row. 
        Chains and combos award power-ups that can be picked up to help with clearing the rest of the orbs.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use the right mouse button to switch the shot orb colour with the secondary colour displayed on the shooter. 
        The game can be paused by pressing Spacebar, clicking outside the game window or 
        by pressing the Menu button on the bottom-right corner.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3 id="Power">Power-ups</h3>
    <img src="media/image3.png" alt="Power-ups" width="800px">
    <p>
        Power-ups are created with combos and chains. The one you get depends on the colour of the matched orbs. 
        Matched orbs drop a powerup next to the path, preferrably towards the bottom. These have to be collected by shooting a regular orb at them before they disappear in 20 seconds.
        There are 2 power-ups you can get per colour and 18 in total. In order they are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li style="color: blue;">Electric Beam - Launching it creates a strong beam removing all orbs in its way.</li>
        <li style="color: blue;">Reverse - Pushes the stream away from the hole for 5 seconds.</li>
        <li style="color: red;">Stop - Stops the streams of orbs from moving forward for 7.5 seconds.</li>
        <li style="color: red;">Fireball - Special orb. When it reaches the stream, it explodes, removing all orbs near it.</li>
        <li style="color:yellow;">Wild Orb - Special orb that matches with any colour. It can even connect two different colours that are on each of its sides.</li>
        <li style="color: yellow;">Accuracy - Shot orbs will move faster. There is also a guiding light pointing at where the orb will reach. Lasts 30 seconds</li>
        <li style="color: green;">Slow - Slows the streams down for 10 seconds.</li>
        <li style="color: green;">Colour Cloud - Special orb. All orbs around it will be turned into the colour of the orb it contacts with.</li>
        <li style="color: blueviolet ;">Anti-Orbs - Creates a number of particles that remove the orbs closest to the hole.</li>
        <li style="color: blueviolet;">Precise Shot - For 15 seconds the orbs you shoot will spawn at your mouse cursor and fly onwards from there, skipping the orbs before that.
            This is useful for reaching orbs that would otherwise be blocked behind a stream.</li>
        <li style="color: black;">Darts - You can shoot 5 darts, each can remove one orb. You cannot swap orbs while darts are in use.</li>
        <li style="color: black;">Triple Shot - Shoots 3 orbs at the same time, each at a slightly different angle and removing any orb in its way.</li>
        <li style="color: white;">Colour Bomb - Special orb. Removes all orbs with the colour of the one it touches.</li>
        <li style="color: white;">Whitening - Special orb. All orbs with the colour of the one it touches will be turned white.</li>
        <li style="color: brown;">Inferno - Burns away some of the orbs on the screen.</li>
        <li style="color: brown;">Poison - A contagious special orb. When it comes into contact with an orb, it dissolves a number of orbs next to it.</li>
        <li style="color: dodgerblue;">Group - Orbs that aren't part of a like-coloured group will be changed to the colour of the one in front of it, forming larger groups.</li>
        <li style="color: dodgerblue;">Blocker - Creates a wrecking ball at the end of all paths. It breaks a number of orbs that reach it and then explodes, removing orbs in its radius.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Note that special orbs cannot pick up power-ups so their power would not be wasted. 
        Orbs not of the main 9 colours, most notably Wild Orb, can drop either of the first 2 power-ups.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3 id="Adventure">Adventure</h3>
    <p>
        Adventure mode is a campaign of levels and the main part of the game. Points accumulate throughout the levels as you play them in order. 
        You have a limited amount of lives to play all the levels through. You start at 3 lives and get an extra every 250,000 points. Campaigns are divided into stages. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When starting a run, you can choose a difficulty and the campaign length. By default there are campaigns with 15 and 20 stages. 
        The longer one uses a more traditional set, where all maps are repeated with an additional one added each stage. 
        Due to more maps than usual, it also becomes significantly longer. The other one, which is the default, drops a map each stage, leaving more room for new maps. 
        When restarting Adventure, you can choose to start from whichever stage. Difficulty impacts the number of orbs and their speed. 
        If you reset an existing Adventure run, you can start from the beginning of any stage.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3 id="Free">Free Play</h3>
    <p>
        There are 2 other game modes, Practice and Endless. Both can be played freely without impacting your Adventure run. They start with a level selection screen. 
        It features a list of maps that can be chosen. To unlock a map in Free Play, you must have reached it in Adventure at any point. 
        The selected map will be previewed and you can then play one level with the map. How the level will function differs slightly between the modes.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Practice, you can select one of 5 difficulties and try out a level like that. The difficulties are as in Adventure, 
        1st difficulty corresponds to stages 1-3, 2nd to stages 4-6 and so on. At first, only the first difficulty is available for each map. 
        In order for a difficulty to be available, you have to complete a Practice level with the same map one step lower.
    </p>
    <p>
        Endless also lets you play on a selected map once. It starts on the easiest difficulty and increases it with each bar fill. 
        It will alternate between increasing the speed and adding a new colour. The orbs will not stop spawning, thereby it cannot really be won. 
        The goal is to survive for as long as you can instead. Your personal best score for the selected map will be displayed on the level selection.
    </p>
    <br>

    <br>

    <h3 id="Scoring">Scoring</h3>
    <p>Each cleared orb gives 100 points. This is multiplied by combos. Starting from chain 3, each chain increases the match score by another 100.</p>
    <p>Clearing a segment gives a bonus depending on the difficulty. It can be 2500, 5000, 7500, 10000, 15000 or 25000 points.</p>
    <p>
        When a level is completed, you get a bonus for each path depending on how far the last pusher was from the hole. 
        0 would be at the hole and 10000 would be at the start of the path. 
        It is possible for the pusher to go behind the starting point, increasing the bonus even further.
    </p>
    <p>When you complete Adventure, you get 150,000 points for each remaining life.</p>
