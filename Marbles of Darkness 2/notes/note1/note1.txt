version 1.2

Startup improvements. Cleaned up the code, unified loading images. 

Display loading steps. New section in text config for loading messages.

Set everything related to the startup screen immediately to prevent things jumping around.

In image config, not setting frame count for an orb sprite defaults to 1.

Completely reworked how orbs are stored in a list.
This makes it much easier to manage and less prone to odd crashes.

However, something about the new orb movement logic made cascades push the orbs further back,
so I specifically had to make the knockback lighter. I don't know what this is about.

Modding fixes - correct launch speed and applied text color everywhere.
Menu backgrounds are also used correctly.

Removed old progress bar sprite from the files.
Fixed level HUD elements positioning.

New configuration options: delayed start, knockback strength, 
powerup drops and warning light rotation.

Now supporting custom orb shadows.
Window display, including the startup screen, resized to 1280x720. Content size remains the same.

New channel link in credits.

Fixed error messaging when loading faulty modding configuration,
preventing additional GameMaker crash reports from popping up.

Added an option to have powerups fall to the shooter like in Luxor, except in levels with pads.

Pads get sucked into the hole on a fail like in MoD 1.


Todo:
fix strong orb knockback
speed up off-screen knockback recovery
fix mid level saves

possibly:
allow more paths and pads
not hit orbs off-screen
android port
debug overlay
