version 1.2

Startup improvements. Cleaned up the code, unified loading images. 

Display loading steps. New section in text config for loading messages.

Set everything related to the startup screen immediately to prevent things jumping around.

In image config, not setting frame count for an orb sprite defaults to 1.

Completely reworked how orbs are stored in a list.
This makes it much easier to manage and less prone to odd crashes.

Modding fixes - correct launch speed and applied text color everywhere.
Menu backgrounds are also used correctly.

New configuration options: delayed start and warning light rotation.

Now supporting custom orb shadows.
Window display, including the startup screen, resized to 1280x720. Content size remains the same.

Removed old progress bar sprite from the files.
Fixed level HUD elements positioning.

New channel link in credits.


Todo:
add dropping powerups like in luxor
fix strong orb knockback.
